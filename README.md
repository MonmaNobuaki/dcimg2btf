This is a script to convert files in the dcimg format from Hamamatsu Photonics to the btf format.

The dcimg format is a format that allows for fast writing, but it cannot be loaded in programs such as Fiji. Therefore, it was necessary to convert it to the more manageable btf format, and I implemented code to directly convert dcimg format to btf format. The conversion speed has been improved with some optimizations.
